[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:09.250
In this section, we're going to look more
at the vertical distances between notes.

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.220
If you remember back to the graph we
originally drew and

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.370
we said the vertical axis represented high
pitches or low pitches.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.340
We're now going to start quantifying
those.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.940
Now, we did say that we had an octave

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.260
which is a real phenomenon, a phenomenon
of nature.

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.680
And we said that was eight notes.

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.830
Of course, it's actually seven note names,
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, back to A.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.300
But, of course, if you look, for instance,
at

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.720
Zack's guitar here, you'll see that there
aren't seven notes.

12
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.140
There's a lot more.

13
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.640
>> So, we did an example where we said
that the

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000
open A string is here and then if you half
that string.

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.635
It's an octave above.

16
00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:53.049
But if we look at the, the discreet
pitches available to us in between.

17
00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:59.242
We've actually got, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9,

18
00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:06.330
10, 11, 12, and then things start to repeat
again, actually.

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.170
So what we're saying is the octave on many
musical instruments nowadays

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.000
isn't divided into eight, as you'd expect
based on the prefix oct.

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.978
Actually, we have 12 distinct pitch
classes.

22
00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:19.206
>> Yeah.

23
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:25.890
Now, if we were to look at the piano, we
will see the same thing again.

24
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100
So looking at what Zack did on guitar.

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.750
If we look at it on the piano, instead of

26
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.450
having frets, of course we've got all of
these white notes.

27
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.700
We've also got these black notes, which
we're now going to introduce.

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.261
So, starting on A, where Zack was, 1,2,

29
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:46.974
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

30
00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:52.720
11, 12, and then we're back to A.

31
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.137
And there's the octave [SOUND].

32
00:01:55.137 --> 00:02:03.300
Now, going back to this A, this distance
here is called a semitone.

33
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.340
Where semi means half.

34
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.840
If that distance is called a semitone this
distance

35
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.659
is called a Tone.

36
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.950
Semitone, half, double it, tone.

37
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.710
That's the same on all instruments.

38
00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.380
Okay, keep that thought in mind.

39
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.910
We're now going to have a look at that
represented back on our stave.

40
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.093
Now, this semitone is the smallest
distance that

41
00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:36.610
we're going to work with at the moment.

42
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.495
Now, if you want to find out more about
that, we have additional material on it.

43
00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:42.102
But let's just say for the moment, the
semitone is

44
00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:46.020
the smallest working distance we can have
between two notes.

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.330
Also, at this point we're going to stop

46
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.510
using A and start orientating ourselves
around C.

47
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.280
And so, here is C on our stave.

48
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.510
The next note up on the line is D.

49
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.390
We can count from C to D, one, two.

50
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.970
It's a tone.

51
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.800
But if we're going to name it in a
different

52
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.600
way, we can say it's an interval of a
second.

53
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.720
One, two, a second.

54
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.220
There

55
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.240
are lots more intervals for us to look at,
and

56
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.280
to do that we're actually going to go back
to the keyboard.

57
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.990
>> So Richard's just talked to you about
this interval, the second, from C to D.

58
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.340
But as he said, there's much more than
that.

59
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.510
So let's have another look through that,
and we'll do that within the octave.

60
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.620
So, we've got C to D.

61
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.425
There's a second, one, two.

62
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:40.139
We ve got C to E, 1 2 3.

63
00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.420
That's a third.

64
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.270
C to F, a fourth.

65
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.610
C to G, a fifth.

66
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.650
C to A, a sixth.

67
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.850
C to B, a seventh.

68
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.970
And from C to C, we're not going to call
that an eighth,

69
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.880
we're going to use the word that we've
already used, which is octave.

70
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.160
But what we don't want you to think

71
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.550
is that intervals are only ever counted
from C.

72
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.140
You know, we could go from G to A, is a
second.

73
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.060
G to C is a fourth.

74
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.300
F to A is a third.

75
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.400
It's all about counting the space.

76
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.560
One, two, three.

77
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.375
F to A is a third.

78
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.949
Now, if we were to play B to C, for
example.

79
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.510
We can see that this is a second.

80
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.800
One, two.

81
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.340
Okay.

82
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.480
Let's play F to G.

83
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.560
F to G.

84
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.770
There's a second.

85
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.950
One, two.

86
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.866
But actually what we see here is that the
B to C

87
00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:56.980
Is a second, but the C is only a semitone
above B.

88
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.840
Whereas, for instance, F to G, 1, 2, is a
second.

89
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.360
But G is actually a tone,

90
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.090
that's to say, two semitones above F.

91
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.770
Now, they are both seconds, and it's

92
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.140
perfectly correct to describe them that
way.

93
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.950
But they do have a different quality.

94
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.220
We're going to talk about that more next
week, so hold that thought, but

95
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.360
at the moment let's use that information
and turn to think about scales.

96
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.648
So now I'm going to turn our attention to
scales.

97
00:05:26.648 --> 00:05:29.096
[flute plays scale]

98
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.378
There's one.

99
00:05:30.378 --> 00:05:33.270
Scales are a pathway.

100
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.890
through an octave, okay?

101
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.530
It's like they're a pool of notes, a set
of notes which melodies can be drawn from.

102
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.051
And if we can have that on the piano as
well,

103
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:48.769
[MUSIC]

104
00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:50.850
I could say if I was doing Julie Andrews.

105
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.970
Which is that is a Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol,
La, Ti, Do.

106
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.720
But I can also say it is, C, D, E, F, G, A, B,
C.

107
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.378
That is why we have orientated ourselves
to C, because we've now

108
00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:10.350
found the scale of C Major, which I'm sure
you've heard of.

109
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.310
Which is very common throughout the world.

110
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.710
Similarities exist in many cultures, and
it's what

111
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.510
lots of music is built on, C Major.

112
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.910
>> And an important thing for you, looking
at this, is when you're

113
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.830
looking at your piano, it's all the white
notes from C to C.

114
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.450
So, Richard just said that this is an
example of a major scale.

115
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.374
And actually, what's important here, is
the relationship between the notes.

116
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.350
The relationship between all of these
notes that are

117
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.800
available to us within this pool of notes.

118
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.320
And actually what we have to remember

119
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.160
here is the difference between tones and
semitones.

120
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.578
So let's look at them again on the last
stave.

121
00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:53.310
C to D.

122
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.350
That's a tone, so I'm going to write T
underneath here for tone.

123
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.780
D to E another tone.

124
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.499
So here is a T.

125
00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:06.277
E to F there is no black note in between
so this is a semi tone.

126
00:07:06.277 --> 00:07:08.433
Which I will show with an S.

127
00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:11.208
F to G a tone.

128
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:14.062
G to A a tone.

129
00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:16.821
A to B, a tone.

130
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:19.580
And again, B to C, a semitone.

131
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.970
There's no blank note in between.

132
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:28.600
So, that gives us a pattern of Tone, Tone,
Semitone, Tone, Tone, Tone, Semitone.

133
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.750
>> So, this pattern of two tones and then
a semi-tone and three more

134
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.765
tones and a final semi-tone is what makes
this scale sound the way it does.

135
00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:42.980
Now we could say that each note on it's own doesn't
actually mean that much, what's

136
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.830
important is how they sound next to each
other in the context.

137
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.370
How they stand next to each other

138
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.600
and build up relationships between one
another.

139
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.110
What this does is it gives us the flavor,
gives us the overall sound.

140
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.700
And if we're going to talk about that
formally in music

141
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.620
theoretic terms, it gives us the quality
of the scale.

142
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.800
An important piece of terminology to
remember, then, is that the

143
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.500
letter name that the scale is named after
is called the tonic.

144
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.690
So, in the case of C Major, C is the
tonic.

145
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.150
In the case of F Major, F is the tonic.

146
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.020
This major scale is also an example.

147
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.200
What is called a Diatonic Scale.

148
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.990
Dia between to tonics.

149
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.750
Diatonic scales are ones where we always
have seven

150
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.430
notes with some pattern of five tones and
two semitones.

151
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.010
Now, lets just have a little bit of the
scale again on the staff.

152
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.000
And, remember we said C to D was a second.

153
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.530
Zack had pointed out that B to C was

154
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.420
also a second but one of the smaller ones:.

155
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.640
A semi tone.

156
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.850
So, I'm going to put this little dart sign
here, to

157
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.630
show that between B and C is the semi
tone.

158
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.450
Now, the other place we have a semi tone
is between E and F.

159
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.130
So, I'm also going to put the dart sign
there.

160
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.990
That will just help us to see, on

161
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.470
the stave, or major scale, where the
semitones are.

162
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.750
So, there you have it, we found C Major.

163
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.340
Through our pattern of tones and

164
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.840
semitones, we've found our first major
scale.

165
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.220
But of course, a scale isn't just a scale.

166
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.380
A scale helps to make music.

167
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.069
C major can give us this.

168
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:34.507
[Piano plays Auld Langs Syne]

169
00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.878
Well, we are in Scotland.

170
00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:37.504
C major can also give us this.

171
00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:45.433
[Flute plays Twinkle Twinkle little star]

172
00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:48.150
And don't think I'm being patronizing
playing Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star.

173
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.110
It's a good exemplifier of the major
scale.

174
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.640
It's also was a good enough tune for

175
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.600
Mozart to write a whole set of variations
on.

176
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.370
While I'm on Mozart, that brings me to a
little disclaimer.

177
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.270
In this course, we're dealing with musical

178
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.920
techniques that are known as the Common
Practice.

179
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.479
And the Common Practice Era is basically
Western Europe from 1600 to 1900.

180
00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:14.640
So, it's very much the music of Bach,
Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, etc.

181
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.430
but there are other forms of music around
the world.

182
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.990
That might use different techniques.

183
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.380
Where possible, we will reference them,
but it has to be

184
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.870
said that the common practice is a good
system to work from.

185
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.441
It applies to quite a lot of pop and rock,
a lot of jazz,

186
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:34.118
quite a lot of folk music, and so that's
our main focus in this course.

187
00:10:34.118 --> 00:10:39.919
